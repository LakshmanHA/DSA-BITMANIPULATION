# Solution Approach

-> For this problem we need more understanding of BIT-Manipulation if you cleanly monitor the exression given expression is nothing but A XOR B
-> Now we need to find minimum XOR in an array
-> Truth Table for XOR
           0 0 0
           1 1 0
           0 1 1
           1 0 1
-> if we want to find minimum that is always present in between large numbers in array
->so we need to sort an array in desecending order and do the xor with next number only now we can minumum
->for code in python please refer python file
